The error is found in line eight, in the case of iterating the result 2 where we can see that the variable t1 takes
value 0 in line 7, and since the result 2 takes the operation defined in line 8 where it takes t0 and divides it by
t1, when it does this in it returns and error because it is impossible to divide by 0.
Since the code find an error in result 2, it does not continue analyzing result 3 or 4, so for this, we start by
removing result 2 and running the code again, once we do this we find that in the cases 3 and 4 a result is returned
correctly so we conclude that the error is only on case 2 since it is not possible dividing by 0.
This will happen anytime parameters c and d of function f take the same value.
That's why results 1, 3 and 4 are properly computed
